# Project 2

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to refactor the code created in project one, and make it smoother and easier to use. Simultaneously, I used Git to continue to commit the changes made, and save the documentation. 

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
Git
Command Line Interface 
Function expressions
Visual Studio Code source code
Non-web server Node.js
```
## What I learned:
I learned how to refactor code into easier, global functions. Throughout the process I had to commit my changes to commit, and learned the different commands needed to save my work through Git.
